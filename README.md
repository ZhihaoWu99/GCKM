Graph Convolutional Kernel Machine
====
This is the implementation of GCKM proposed in our paper:

Zhihao Wu, Zhao Zhang, and Jicong Fan*. [Graph Convolutional Kernel Machine versus Graph Convolutional Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SFfOt1oDsX), NeurIPS 2023.

The code will be available soon, feel free to contact me via email if you don't mind the unorganized code :)
